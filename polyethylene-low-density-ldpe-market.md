<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethylene Low Density (LDPE) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Process</li><li>Tubular Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyethylene Low Density (LDPE) is produced using two primary methods: the autoclave process and the tubular process. The autoclave process involves polymerizing ethylene in a pressurized reactor, resulting in a highly branched structure, which contributes to LDPE's low density and flexibility. In contrast, the tubular process involves continuous polymerization in a tubular reactor, yielding a more consistent product with improved efficiency and lower production costs. Both methods cater to various applications, including packaging, films, and molded products.</p></p>
