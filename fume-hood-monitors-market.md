<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hood Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fume hood monitors serve to enhance safety in laboratory environments by ensuring effective ventilation. Ducted fume hoods are connected to an external ventilation system, expelling harmful fumes outside, making them ideal for handling hazardous materials. In contrast, ductless fume hoods filter air through HEPA or activated carbon filters, recirculating clean air back into the lab, suitable for less volatile substances. Both types are critical for protecting users from toxic exposure and maintaining a safe workspace.</p></p>
