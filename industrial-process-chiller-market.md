<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Process Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled Chiller</li><li>Water Cooled Chiller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial process chiller market comprises two primary types: air-cooled chillers and water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled chillers dissipate heat directly into the atmosphere and are ideal for smaller applications or areas with limited water supply. In contrast, water-cooled chillers use water from cooling towers to remove heat, making them more efficient for larger operations. Both types are essential in industries like manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and food processing, where precise temperature control is crucial for optimal performance and product quality.</p></p>
